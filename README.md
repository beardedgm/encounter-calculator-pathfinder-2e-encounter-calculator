# Pathfinder 2e Encounter Calculator

This project is a simple encounter level calculator for the Pathfinder Second Edition role-playing game. The tool is built entirely with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The calculator lets you select your party's average level and choose an encounter type (number of creatures or boss/minion setups). It then displays the appropriate creature levels based on the official guidelines.
